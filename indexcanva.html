    <h2>MODULE 4: USE OF COLOR, TYPOGRAPHY AND VISUAL HIERARCHY</h2>
    
    <div class="topic" id="tema1">
        <h3>Use of Color, Typography and Visual Hierarchy</h3>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Apply basic design principles such as the use of color, font selection, and visual hierarchy to create balanced and legible compositions.</p>
        
        <div class="subtopic">
            <h4>Basic Color Theory: Harmonies, Psychology and Palettes</h4>
            <p>Imagine you are designing a logo for a yoga brand. Would you use bright red and black? Probably not, because those colors convey energy, danger, or luxury, not tranquility. Color is not just decoration; it is an incredibly powerful non-verbal communication tool.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What is Color Psychology?</strong></p>
            <p>It is the study of how colors affect our perceptions, emotions, and behaviors. Each color evokes different sensations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Blue:</strong> Trust, calm, security (used by banks and social networks like Facebook and Twitter).</li>
                <li><strong>Red:</strong> Urgency, excitement, passion (used in sales, food, to call to action).</li>
                <li><strong>Green:</strong> Nature, health, growth (used by organic, environmental, and financial brands).</li>
                <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Optimism, youth, attention (perfect for highlighting key elements).</li>
                <li><strong>Black:</strong> Luxury, elegance, sophistication (high-end brands).</li>
                <li><strong>White:</strong> Simplicity, purity, cleanliness (minimalist spaces, tech).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Color Harmonies: The Formulas for Combining</strong></p>
            <p>They are preset schemes that guarantee that the chosen colors work well together visually:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monochromatic:</strong> Uses a single color in different shades, tints, and tones. It is a safe, elegant, and very easy combination to achieve.</li>
                <li><strong>Analogous:</strong> Uses colors that are next to each other on the color wheel (e.g., blue, blue-green, and green). Creates harmonious and serene designs.</li>
                <li><strong>Complementary:</strong> Combines colors that are directly opposite on the color wheel (e.g., red and green, blue and orange). Provides maximum contrast and impact, ideal for drawing attention.</li>
                <li><strong>Triadic:</strong> Uses three colors equidistant on the color wheel (e.g., red, yellow, and blue). It is a vibrant and balanced palette, but requires more care to avoid saturating the design.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Color Palettes: Your Visual Tool Kit</strong></p>
            <p>A color palette is a set of colors selected strategically to be used consistently in all your designs. A typical palette includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary color:</strong> The main color of your brand.</li>
                <li><strong>Secondary color:</strong> A color that complements the primary one.</li>
                <li><strong>Accent color:</strong> A contrasting color (often from a complementary harmony) to highlight buttons or important information.</li>
                <li><strong>Neutral colors:</strong> Grays, blacks, whites, or beiges for texts and backgrounds.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="subtopic">
            <h4>Applying Brand Colors in Canva</h4>
            <p>Having a defined palette is useless if it is not applied consistently. Canva makes this easy with a tool called <strong>Brand Kit</strong>.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What is the Brand Kit? (Pro Feature)</strong></p>
            <p>It is a centralized space where you save your brand's key visual assets: logo, fonts, and, most importantly, <strong>your color palette</strong>.</p>
            
            <p><strong>How to Set It Up and Use It:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Go to the Canva homepage and look for the <strong>"Brand Hub"</strong> or <strong>"Brand Kit"</strong> tab in the sidebar (available for Pro accounts).</li>
                <li>In the "Brand colors" section, click on "Add a color".</li>
                <li>Enter the <strong>HEX code</strong> of each color in your palette (e.g., #FF5733 for a specific orange). This guarantees absolute precision.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Magic!</strong> Now, when you edit any design, your brand palette will appear at the top of the color selector. With a single click, you can apply your official colors to any text, shape, or background, ensuring total consistency across all your materials.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="subtopic">
            <h4>Typography: Font Selection and Combination</h4>
            <p>Typography is the voice of your design. Text in Comic Sans does not "sound" the same as the same text in Times New Roman.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Basic Typeface Families:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Serif:</strong> They have small "feet" or serifs at the end of the letters (e.g., Times New Roman, Georgia). They convey tradition, trust, formality. Ideal for long print texts.</li>
                <li><strong>Sans-Serif:</strong> "Without serifs". Clean and modern (e.g., Arial, Helvetica, Open Sans). They convey minimalism, modernity, accessibility. They are the standard for web and screens.</li>
                <li><strong>Decorative or Display:</strong> Very stylized and unique fonts (e.g., fonts that simulate handwriting, graffiti, etc.). They should be used with <strong>extreme moderation</strong>, only for very short titles or logos. They are difficult to read in long texts.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>How to Combine Fonts: The Golden Rule</strong></p>
            <p>Never use more than 2 or 3 different fonts in a single design. To combine:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Choose a font for Headings:</strong> It is usually a font with personality, bold, that captures attention.</li>
                <li><strong>Choose a font for Body text:</strong> It must be extremely legible, clean (usually a sans-serif), and work well in small sizes.</li>
                <li><strong>Create Contrast:</strong> Combine a serif with a sans-serif (style contrast) or a condensed font with a wide one (structure contrast). <strong>Avoid</strong> combining two fonts that are very similar (e.g., Arial with Helvetica), as it looks like a mistake.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Spacing (Tracking and Leading):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Leading:</strong> The space between lines of text. Very tight leading tires the eyes; very wide leading disconnects the lines.</li>
                <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> The general space between all the letters in a block of text. Slightly increasing it can greatly improve legibility (especially in uppercase).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="subtopic">
            <h4>Visual Hierarchy: How to Guide the Viewer's Eye</h4>
            <p>Hierarchy is the art of organizing elements to visually communicate what is most important, second, and third. You guide the viewer's eye on a controlled journey through your design.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Tools to Create Hierarchy:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Size:</strong> The most obvious and effective. The largest element is the first thing seen (the main title).</li>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Play with color contrast (dark text on light background or vice versa), weight contrast (text in <strong>bold</strong> vs. regular text), and size contrast.</li>
                <li><strong>Position and Spacing:</strong> Elements isolated with a lot of white space around them (called "negative space") naturally attract attention. Placement at the top or center is usually more prominent.</li>
                <li><strong>Typography:</strong> Using a different font, in uppercase, or in a distinctive color for titles creates a clear separation from the body text.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="subtopic">
            <h4>Principles of Alignment and Spacing for a Clean Design</h4>
            <p>This is the secret to making a design go from looking "amateur" to looking "professional". Clutter and misalignment generate distrust.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Alignment:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Never place elements randomly.</strong> Always align everything to a common invisible line.</li>
                <li>Use the <strong>alignment guides</strong> (the pink/magenta lines that appear in Canva) to align the edges of text boxes, images, and icons with each other.</li>
                <li>Choose a type of text alignment (left, centered, right) and keep it consistent throughout the design. Left alignment is usually the most legible for long texts.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Consistent Spacing (Golden Rule):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consistency</strong> in the space between elements is crucial.</li>
                <li>If the space between a title and a paragraph is 20 pixels, that same space should be applied between <em>all</em> titles and their paragraphs.</li>
                <li>If the space between a photo and its description is 10 pixels, repeat it in all photos.</li>
                <li>This uniformity creates rhythm, order, and a sense of neatness that the brain perceives as professional.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <h4>Suggested Activities:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Color Palette Creation:</strong> Design a small panel in Canva using a harmonious color palette (e.g., monochromatic, complementary).</li>
                <li><strong>Text Exercise:</strong> Create a quote or slogan using at least two different fonts and applying visual hierarchy.</li>
            </ul>
